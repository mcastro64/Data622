# Exploratory Data Analysis
Review the structure and content of the data and answer questions such as:
Are the features (columns) of your data correlated?
What is the overall distribution of each variable?
Are there any outliers present?
What are the relationships between different variables?
How are categorical variables distributed?
Do any patterns or trends emerge in the data?
What is the central tendency and spread of each variable?
Are there any missing values and how significant are they? 

Our data is comprised of 41188 observations with 20 features + label column "y". Our dependent variable "y" is a binary categorical/factor column with values Y/N. The dataframe consists no missing values.

The classification goal is to predict if the client will subscribe a term deposit (variable y).


Drop 'nonexistent' poutcome values.

outliers?
Month/day field? is this a time series?

# Algorithm Selection
Select two or more machine learning algorithms presented so far that could be used to train a model
(no need to train models - I am only looking for your recommendations).
What are the pros and cons of each algorithm you selected?
Which algorithm would you recommend, and why?
Are there labels in your data? Did that impact your choice of algorithm?
How does your choice of algorithm relates to the dataset?
Would your choice of algorithm change if there were fewer than 1,000 data records, and why? 

- Logistic regression

# Pre-processing
Data Cleaning - improve data quality, address missing data, etc.
Dimensionality Reduction - remove correlated/redundant data than will slow down training
Feature Engineering - use of business knowledge to create new features
Sampling Data - using sampling to resize datasets
Data Transformation - regularization, normalization, handling categorical variables
Imbalanced Data - reducing the imbalance between classes

- standardization
- drop columns (day of week, month)
- one-hot encoding for certain fatures
